My Third HTML/CSS Project
North Star Is My Third (HTML/CSS Only) Project, It's a Template Simulate a Website for Young Businessmen to Grow Bigger on Both Personal & Business Sides,
With a Paid Monthly Membership For The Best Courses in the Field.
I Used Only HTML & CSS to Make it, Making it Animated And Fully Responsive No Matter The Device, It Took me a Week or so to Finish it.
Most of the Porblems I Faced During Making it were Choosing the Pictures to match the Visual Identity and resizing them. Also Creating The Content itself was a kind of Challenginig.
It Contains 15 Sections: Header, Landing, Articles, Gallery, Features, Testimonials, Team Members, Services, Client Stats, Work Steps, Events, Pricing, Videos, Stats, And Footer.
i'd like to Thank Engineer Osama Mohammed AKA: Elzero (elzero.org) For His Youtube CSS Course That Helped Me a lot with the Design.
And Of Course The Odin Project Which Motivated Me to Enter The Field Of Web Development.
